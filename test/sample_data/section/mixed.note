### Links
If you missed the stuff in the parent directory, there are [todos](/todos.note), [questions](/questions.note), [definitions](/definitions.note), and more.

You can link to external sites like the [NY Times](https://nytimes.com)

Some links may become [broken](/does/not/exist.note) over time, or contain [typos](/lokations.note). Thankfully there is tooling to identify that.

Its also useful to be able to use [relative paths](../todos.note) to link to other files
